## Description

Simple and efficient London Bus app written in pure vanilla JavaScript using lastest features. 

## Problem

I want to be quickly find next arrivals at selected bus stop, chosen based on my location or code displayed at the stop. I would like to bookmark selected stops and fetch fresh predictions when I want.
I need this app to be fast and lightweight, working with and without GPS and even poor internet access.


## Tech used to solve
* Plain vanilla js, not meant to be comapatible with all browsers but to utilise the latest in web technologies

## Learning Outcomes
* HTML template element
* Custom elements
* It is not always easy to style custom elements protected with shadow root
* (progressive web app)
